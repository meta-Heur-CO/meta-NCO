# Meta-Learning of Neural Combinatorial Optimisation Heuristics

This repository contains the code associated with the paper *Meta-Learning of Neural Combinatorial Optimisation Heuristics*, submitted at ICML 2021. The project consists of 2 folders:

1. AM_Model : meta-learning of an Attention-based model for NCO
2. GCN_Model : meta-learning of a GCN-based model for NCO

Each folder contains the code as well as the documentation to run the experiments.
